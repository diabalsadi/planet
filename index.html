      <h2>About Our Solar System</h2>
      <div>
        Our solar system consists of the sun and the celestial objects that are bound to it by gravity,
        including the eight planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and more.

      <h2>Planets in Our Solar System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Mercury</h3>
          <div>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun in our solar system. It has a surface that
            experiences extreme temperature variations, ranging from extremely hot to extremely cold. Mercury has a very
            thin atmosphere, and it completes an orbit around the sun in just about 88 Earth days.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Venus</h3>
          <div>Venus is known for its thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide. It is similar in size and
            composition to Earth but has a hostile environment with high temperatures due to a greenhouse effect. Venus
            is often referred to as the "evening star" or "morning star" and has a rotation opposite to most other
            planets in the solar system.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Earth</h3>
          <div>Earth is our home planet and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a diverse environment,
            including oceans, continents, and a variety of ecosystems. Earth orbits the sun at an average distance of
            about 93 million miles and completes one orbit approximately every 365.25 days.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Mars</h3>
          <div>Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide on its surface.
            It
            has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system, Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively.
            Mars has been a target for robotic exploration, and there are plans for future human missions to the planet.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Jupiter</h3>
          <div>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a
            strong magnetic field and numerous moons, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa,
            Ganymede, and Callisto). Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been observed for
            centuries.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Saturn</h3>
          <div>Saturn is known for its stunning ring system, which consists of a multitude of icy particles. The planet
            itself is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has a complex and dynamic atmosphere, and its moon
            Titan has a thick atmosphere and is the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Uranus</h3>
          <div>Uranus is an ice giant with a blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It
            rotates
            on its side, likely due to a collision with a massive object in its distant past. Uranus has a system of
            rings and a diverse set of moons.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Neptune</h3>
          <div>Neptune is the farthest known planet from the sun and is another ice giant. It has a dynamic atmosphere
            with strong winds and the fastest-known winds in the solar system. Neptune has a system of rings and a
            notable dark spot similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</div>
